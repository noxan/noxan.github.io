# Github: Use SSH over the HTTPS port

You are traveling and want to upload your latest changes to Github but the public wifi blocks the SSH port? If this sounds familiar to you, then the following link might be useful to you.

[Github: Using SSH over the HTTPS port](https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port/)

And the same service is also offered to users by Bitbucket, just check the following link.
